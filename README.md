Sets [swww](https://github.com/LGFae/swww)'s wallpaper based on [river](https://codeberg.org/river/river)'s focused tags.

## Usage

Install [`river-bedload`](https://git.sr.ht/~novakane/river-bedload). `river-bedload` is used to stream river's events (tag changes) to `river-sww`.

Next, install `river-swww`:

```sh
cargo install river-swww
```

Typically, `river-swww` is added as a service that starts with `river` (for example, by adding a runit service entry that invokes `river-swww`). `river-swww` could also be added to `~/.config/river/init`, however, the service won't be automatically restarted upon termination.

## Configuration

Upon first run, a configuration file with default values is generated at `~/.config/river-swww/config.json`. After customizing the configuration, restart `river-swww`.

The following keys will configure river-swww:

* `swww_args`: Command-line arguments to pass to `swww`. This is useful for configuring transition settings.
* `default`: A path to a default wallpaper, used as a fallback when a tag is applied that doesn't have a matching entry in `tags`.
* `tags`: A map keyed by tag name to the associated wallpaper's path.

Example configuration:

```json
{
  "swww_args": "--transition-type simple --transition-fps 30 --transition-step 12",
  "default": "/home/lina/Pictures/Wallpapers/default.jpg",
  "tags": {
    "1": "/home/lina/Pictures/Wallpapers/1.jpg",
    "2": "/home/lina/Pictures/Wallpapers/2.jpg",
    "3": "/home/lina/Pictures/Wallpapers/3.jpg",
    "4": "/home/lina/Pictures/Wallpapers/4.jpg",
    "5": "/home/lina/Pictures/Wallpapers/5.jpg"
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

Run `river-swww` interactively and monitor its output as river's tag focus changes.
